1. First I made a repository from github website names as Tensorflow-keras-scripts
2. Now I added a cats and dogs classifier file.
3. Now I'll try to add it into my github repository.

#### command used ####

1. git clone https://github.com/amitdev101/Tensorflow-keras-scripts
2. go inside this folder "Tensorflow-keras-scripts"
3. As this folder was empty so i first call "git init" command
4. Now I add a file "cats_and_dogs_classifier_tutorial.py" here inside the folder.
5. Now run command "git add ." 
6. Now I'll try to commit the changes.
